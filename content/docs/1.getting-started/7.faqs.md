##### What is a domain?

#answer
A target is the specific URL of a web application or website you intend to scan, identified by its name or IP and protocol (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS. For example, https://app.domain.com and https://docs.domain.com are distinct targets due to their different subdomains (app vs. docs), despite sharing the base domain (domain.com). This distinction allows ZeroThreat to treat them as separate entities for scanning purposes.
