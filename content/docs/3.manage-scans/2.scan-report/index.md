This report is structured into different sections, each focusing on a specific security aspect. It covers web application and API vulnerabilities, offering insights into detected weaknesses and their severity. The report also evaluates SSL configurations, server security, and mail server settings to identify potential risks in encryption and communication channels. Additionally, it examines the technology stack, detecting outdated JavaScript packages and server-side frameworks that might introduce security gaps.

Beyond application security, the Scan Report highlights information exposure risks, including leaked sensitive data, API keys, and cloud misconfigurations. Each finding is categorized based on severity, enabling you to focus on critical threats first. You also have the flexibility to review reported findings, mark them as critical, or ignore those that are not relevant to your environment.

By analyzing the Scan Report, security teams and developers can gain a clear understanding of their security risks and take proactive measures to strengthen their defenses.
