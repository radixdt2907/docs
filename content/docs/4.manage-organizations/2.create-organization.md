##### **Define the Purpose and Scope**

**3. Provide Organization Details**

- **Organization Name:** Enter a meaningful and unique name that identifies your organization.

##### **Tip: Ensure Compliance with Data Residency Requirements**

###### Double-check the storage location to comply with any regional or organizational data governance policies. For instance, regulations like **GDPR (EU)**, **CCPA (US)**, **HIPAA (US)**, **PIPEDA (Canada)**, **LGPD (Brazil)**, and others often mandate that sensitive data is stored and processed within specific geographical boundaries. Proper configuration ensures compliance and avoids legal complications.
